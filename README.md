# Props Tutorial App

## Overview
This is a simple React application designed to assist junior developers in understanding how to use props at the application level and grasp the concept of passing functions as props to manipulate data. The motivation behind creating this app was to aid my younger brother in comprehending state and props as he progresses in his React journey.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this app is to teach junior developers about prop drilling â€“ the process of passing props from a parent component through intermediate components to a deeply nested child component. By going through this tutorial, developers will learn not only how to utilize prop data but also how to pass functions as props to manipulate that data effectively.

## Contents
- **Step-by-step notes**: Detailed instructions are provided to guide users through the process of understanding props and prop drilling.
  
- **Example of what not to do**: A concrete example is included to demonstrate common mistakes and pitfalls when dealing with props, helping users learn through contrast.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.
